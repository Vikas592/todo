## Create a ToDo app
---
1. At the top, there are two components textField(TF1) to accept a string and a button(B1) associated with that to add the string in bullet points.
2. When the user enters any text in the textField(TF1) and hits the button(B1) the string should be added in bullet points below the textField(TF1).
3. User can add N numbers strings in the bullet points.
4. At the end of each bullet point, there is editButton(B2) pencil icon and deleteButton(B3) dustbin icon.
5. On clicking editButton(B2) associated with any bullet point, the string in the respective bullet point appears in the textField(TF1) and the user can edit that string.
6. On clicking the deleteButton(B3) the associated bullet point string gets changed into a strikethrough string and the respective editButton(B2) gets disabled.

You need to do the above task using.
1. React
2. React + Redux
3. React + Redux tool kit

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
